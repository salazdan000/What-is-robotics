# What-is-robotics
Robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering and science that includes mechanical engineering, electronics 
engineering, computer science, and others. Robotics deals with the design, construction, operation, and use of robots, as 
well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing.

These technologies are used to develop machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human actions. Robots can be 
used in any situation and for any purpose, but today many are used in dangerous environments, manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive. Robots can take on any form but some are made to 
resemble humans in appearance. This is said to help in the acceptance of a robot in certain replicative behaviors usually 
performed by people. Such robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition, and basically anything a human 
can do. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature, contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics.

The concept of creating machines that can operate autonomously dates back to classical times, but research into the 
functionality and potential uses of robots did not grow substantially until the 20th century. Throughout history, it has
been frequently assumed that robots will one day be able to mimic human behavior and manage tasks in a human-like fashion. 
Today, robotics is a rapidly growing field, as technological advances continue; researching, designing, and building new 
robots serve various practical purposes, whether domestically, commercially, or militarily.
